  <h3>
    Raphael
    <span>"The Transfiguration"</span>
  </h3>
  <p>
    This painting is full of symbolism. Some people believe that the painting
    represents the different aspects of Jesus's nature, both human and divine.
    Others believe that the painting is an allegory of the soul's journey to
    enlightenment.

  <h3>Bartolomé Esteban Murillo <span>"Virgin and Child"</span></h3>
  <p>
    Murillo's paintings of the Virgin and Child are popular because he imbues
    the traditional theme with a sense of intimacy and sweetness. This is
    evident in the soft modelling of the figures, as well as in the infant's
    momentary glance away from the Virgin.
