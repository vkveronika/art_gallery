  <h3>Frans van Mieris (II) "The Grocer’s Shop"</h3>
  <p>following the footsteps of the painter's ancestors</p>
  <p>
    This painting, The Grocer's Shop, can serve as a pendant to The Poultry
    Seller, which was painted by the father of Frans van Mieris the Younger and
    is also on display. The egg basket at the upper right appears to have been
    passed down through the generations.
